# Kittenbot Meowbit

Radomir Dopieralski <sheep@sheep.art.pl>:

> Meowbit uses the same display as PewPew M4, this works:
https://github.com/python-ugame/circuitpython-stage/blob/master/pewpew_m4/pew.py

> Just copy it onto the CIRCUITPY drive, either into the lib directory,
or directly to the top directory.

> You can also copy https://github.com/pewpew-game/game-m4-menu to have a nice
game selection menu.
